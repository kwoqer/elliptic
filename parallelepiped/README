Name
	parallelepiped


Purpose
	Computes the minimum volume parallelepiped enclosing a
	given set of three-dimensional points.


Reference paper
	Minimal enclosing parallelepiped in 3D, by Frédéric Vivien and
	Nicolas Wicker, research report LIP 2002-49 and INRIA 4685,
	December 2002. To appear in Computational Geometry: Theory and
	Applications.


Program dependence
	This library relies on the qconvex program of the qhull
	library for the computation of the convex hull of the set of
	points (along as some characteristics of this convex hull).

	The qhull library is available from:
        <http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/qhull>
	<http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/qhull>
	<http://www.thesa.com/software/qhull>

	The qconvex program is called by a system call in the library,
	the arguments beging exchange through files. This is rather
	ugly. But he allowed us to be as less qhull version dependent
	as possible.


Compilation
	The library should compile and run out of the box. To run the
	test program or any program using this library, the path to
	the qconvex program should be in your PATH environment
	variable (whatever its name and syntax is).

	The test_parallelepiped program shows an example of use of the
	library.


Known to work
	This program was tested with g++ 2.95.4, 3.0.4, and 3.3.1 on
	Linux 2.4.
